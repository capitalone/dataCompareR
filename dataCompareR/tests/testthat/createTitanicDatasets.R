# Changes to Titanic dataset
# The following should be mentioned as the output of dataCompareR function.
# To load all Titanic dataset run load("titanic_datasets.RData").
# The base dataset (titanic) is a slightly altered of the original titanic dataset.
# All differences mentioned below compare an altered version of data to the base dataset.
# The differences are identical for all altered versions
# (titanic2, titanic2DataTable, titanic2Tibble, titanic2Matrix)
#
#
#* `Embarked` has different order of levels, this results in different rows.
#* `Cabin` has additional levels, this however does not result in different rows (they are the same via `as.character`)
#* `HasSurvived` has additional level: NaN. Line 5 has HasSurvived as NaN, but in the basel dataset it is NA.
#
#The rest of the differences are demonstrated on the `Name` column:
#
# * Row 1: very long string, difference at the end
#* Row 2: additional spaces at the beginning
#* Row 3: additional spaces at the end
#* Row 4: additional spaces at the beginning and at the end
#* Row 5: Na vs NaN
#* Row 6: Inserted new line instead of spaces
#* Row 7: name in lowercase
#* Row 8: name in uppercase
#* Row 9: special characters included

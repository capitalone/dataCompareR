The `dataCompareR` package is in a stable state, and we will continue to add features and functionality as the community of users asks for them.

We are targeting December 2022 to work through the following backlog of issues:
* Summaries fail if tables are pulled out of named lists (#105)
* Create summary percent agreement (#118)
